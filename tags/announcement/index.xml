      <description>As a precursor to the usual more elaborate announcement, I would like you to save the date: put it in your calendars, start your Pavlovian juices flowing, and get psyched!
May the 4th be with you, and with us all&amp;hellip; is the date for the next Three Thing Game. At least that is when it starts. As usual it will last for 24 hours, concluding on Saturday 5th.</description>
