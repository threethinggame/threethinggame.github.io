&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that Josh Naylor, one of our lovely and accomplished alumni, is going to be making a guest appearance. He will be talking a little bit about what he does at Unity, will be able to offer career advice, and he will also be talking tech, such as how to prototype in Unity. The latter of course will be particularly useful in a game jam context. Speaking of game jams, I hear that there is quite a good one coming up. &lt;a href=&#34;http://threethinggame.com/post/2018-03-18-may-the-fourth/&#34;&gt;http://threethinggame.com/post/2018-03-18-may-the-fourth/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
