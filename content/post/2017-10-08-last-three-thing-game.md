Lyrics:

Caffeine drinks lay all around,  
Next to crisps and sweetie mounds  
Cursor’s blinking on the screen  
There’s a bug, what does it mean?

Code is swimming through our heads  
Bodies yearning for our beds  
But we’re working through the night  
Cause the deadline’s really tight  

We have got three things  
And we need to make a ga-ame  
Sublime!  
This is fun, we shout  
But we’re running out of time  
Damn  

Last Three Thing Game  
We had octopai and ink  
Octopuses though I think  
Llamas jumping over things  

Last Three Thing Game  
ASCII text was all the rage  
Occlusion shading was engaged  
And Psionic battle raged  

Last Three Thing Game  
Tomato ketchup made in space  
In a psychedelic race  
Spinning with balletic grace  

Last Three Thing Game  
Blossom Bakeries made pies  
All procedurally, nice!  

This Three Thing Game  
Do it all again
