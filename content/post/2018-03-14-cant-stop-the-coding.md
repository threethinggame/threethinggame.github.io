A new music cover to entice the masses to Three Thing Game. This is for the 4th and 5th May 2018 event.

This one was the first to be picked up by YouTube's automatic content id which I am choosing to take as a compliment of my singing.

Lyrics:

You gave me Three Things, I wonder how,
We'll make a game that makes the players go wow!

Oh, we'll be coding, all through the night,
We're fuelled by pizza 'til the morning light

We'll build three things in to our game,
And not just superficially.
They're embedded in the gameplay,
Just you wait, oooh.

Got my team mates working with me,
So enthusiastically,
It's just great to be creative, with my friends.

And deep in the night when you're feeling sad,
With all those bugs that are driving you mad,
You may feel like you're needing your bed,
That's when you see it, then you see it, can't you see it?

You're filled with inspiration now and just code, code, code,
Nailed that algorithm now,
So just code, code, code, code on.

Check in to Subversion next,
And then code, code, code.
You're half way to the deadline now so keep coding.

I can't stop programming,
So just code, code, code,
I can't stop programming.
So just code, code, code, code on.
