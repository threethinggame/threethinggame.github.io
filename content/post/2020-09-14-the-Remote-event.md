The king is dead, long live the king!

Sadly, the sneaky virus lock down hit just as we were about to have our last event and in the scramble to move all of our teaching online we weren't able to sort Three Thing Game in time for it to go ahead back in March.

But we are back, so save the date, the weekend of Halloweeeeeeeeeen! We will be experimenting with a fully remote event which should be interesting.
