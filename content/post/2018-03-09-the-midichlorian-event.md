As a precursor to the usual more elaborate announcement, I would like you to save the date: put it in your calendars, start your Pavlovian juices flowing, and get psyched!

May the 4th be with you, and with us all... is the date for the next Three Thing Game. At least that is when it starts. As usual it will last for 24 hours, concluding on Saturday 5th.
