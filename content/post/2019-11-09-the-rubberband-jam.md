Lyrics below:
Dust me off my trusty keyboard, slide across my mouse.
Got a fire burning deep inside that an ocean cannot douse.
Join with us, the time has come to see what you can do,
For just Three Things is all you need to make your dreams come true.

The time has come again for the Three Thing Game.
Nothing can quite compare to the Three Thing Game.
That's why you have to come to the Three Thing Game jam…

No doubt, you'll surely know what I mean, 
It'll all come clear, when you gather your team.

Ask around and you will hear this game jam is the best,
Employers say if want a job this is time you should invest,
It's a chance to practice all your skills and build your confidence,
If you're undecided now's the time to get down of the fence.

The time has come again for the Three Thing Game.
Nothing can quite compare to the Three Thing Game.
That's why you have to come to the Three Thing Game jam…

No game jam can compare, no, it is the best, it is the best,
Come on and register, now, it is the best, it is the best,

Do doo doooo

It's what you need to get employed

If your CV has got a void

Three Thing, Three Thing Game is here.
