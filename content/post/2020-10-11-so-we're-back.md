Inspired by the magnificent performance of You'll be back from the Hamilton musical.

Lyrics below:
It's pants, we were all set to go, but were dealt such a blow to our plans.

You bawl, cause it's been far too long since I broke out in song for you all.

We can't meet, because of the virus pandemic that's spread 'cross the land.

But we won't be beat,
We've made preparations to bring you our game jam.

So we're back, remote-l-ly,
With an auction on the web, you see.
For your words, for your things, 
And who knows what combos bidding bringsâ€¦

Fish, balloon, bicycle...

I just know that you will have a ball.
 
So sign up, and bow down, and prostrate yourself before me And my Shiny shiny crown.
