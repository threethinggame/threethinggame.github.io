If you can quite believe it, it has been a whole half a century of Computer Science at the University of Hull, and this edition of the magnificent Three Thing Game was timed to coincide with our celebration event.

As a nod to Three Thing Game's long history (established all the way back in 2011), the collection of theme words for the teams was collated from the early years of the event.

In a slight deviation from the usual routine, we allocated the titular Three Things to each of the teams on Wednesday giving the teams an extra day in the run up to the on site sprint on the day of the great student and alumni aniversary gathering. In the end there were 9 games submitted and the teams presented their creations to the celebration crowd.

The crowd ranked the submissions and coming out on top was the team Live Laugh Lovers. The made their game "Would You Love Fries With That?" using the Monogame framework, and backed by their three things: Burger King, neon, and swimming pool. The crowd appreciated the humourous, quirky, narrative fun. 

A special mention also goes to the Milkybar team whose game "The Debtor's Grimoire" was rated the highest by their fellow developers.
