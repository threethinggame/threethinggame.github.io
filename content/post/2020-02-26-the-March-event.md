It is my pleasure to announce that the magnificent, marvelous, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, Three Thing Game is a go!
For those not in the know, Three Thing Game is a Game Jam run over a weekend. Teams of enthusiasts (that’s you people, as well as me and my ‘kind’) gather to challenge themselves to create a game based on 3 random words that they will be given. At the end of the weekend you get to subject your game to a thorough Judging against various criteria like: adherence to the Things, how complete is your game, and how much money you slip the judge discreetly.
Over the years teams from all years of study have made some great stuff, some of which has even been published in various app stores. So you should definitely not be discouraged from taking part in your first year. This is an excellent opportunity to put your skills in to practice, to hone your craft. This is also one of those ‘extra-curricular’ activities that help to distinguish you in the eyes of potential employers from the hundreds of other people that will be graduating from here at the same time. 

## Hullumni

I am very pleased to invite our alumni to come play with us. Many of our former students are Three Thing Game veterans and it would be great to see them again. You are very welcome to come with preformed teams (getting the band back together perhaps) or go stag and see who else comes. Also if you want to have some time to talk to the students in your professional capacity (maybe you want to entice them to your company) then you are welcome to do that also. You won’t have access to the canvas files below, but if you are interesting to taking part in any capacity, then please get in touch.  

## Celebration

We will spend time having all of the teams (that want to) showcasing their work to all of the participants. So we will down tools at the usual 1500 on Sunday and transfer to the lecture room where each of the teams can present the video that they have made of their game.

Don't worry though. For those seeking Judgment, the scrutiny of your peers will still be available for prize and pride in the form of the People's Choice.

## So what do I need to do?

I am glad you asked. First thing is to put the date in your diary. 

Remember, remember the (weekend of the 21st and 22nd) of March game making, three things, the lot. I see no reason why Game Jam season should ever be forgot.

Form teams! Generally speaking, you want to have a maximum of 5 people in your team. Under the pressure of 24 hours it can be very difficult to integrate the efforts of large numbers of people. Even 5 is pushing it a little. You can register online here: https://forms.gle/netTgLXc3iE2gcgk6.  

Registration will close on Wednesday 18th March so please get your registration forms to me before then.

There are a limited number of places as everyone needs to be able to fit in the big lab and these are on a first come first served basis.

If you would like to take part but can’t form a team then you can go stag and be a team of one (some people have made this work very well before) or you could identify on your form that you would like to be in a team by using “need a team” as the team name on the form. We can then pool you together into teams. Where there is a will there is a way.

## itch.io

I would like to try out itch.io for hosting some of the bits and bobs for the games this year. So I have set up a jam site there which is at the end of this link: https://itch.io/jam/three-thing-game-march-2020. Using this site you can host the games that you make, including screenshots, videos, and playable demos etc. This will be neat for disseminating your excellent efforts.


## Finding teams

You may already have a team in mind which is fine, but check out Hull Games: Bonus Level Discord site. In short it is a place for us to communicate amongst each other about making games, whether you are an artist, programmer, or musician, or anything else really. It is here:

https://discord.gg/QM4turg 

There is a room in there called '#looking for help' where you may consider putting things like 'looking for a digital artist/musician/programmer to join our team' so we can properly integrate some amazing diverse skillset teams.

## When do I get my words?

Excellent question. On **Wednesday 18th March at 1300 in Lecture Theatre Large in the Applied Science building**. So I guess that you probably want to remember that as well.

## What about on the day?

At **1000 Saturday 21st March** we will kick off in the **Fenner 052/65 Computer Lab**. You may have allocated places depending on your team size.

## My computer is amazing, can I bring it?

Yes you can, but it is wholly your responsibility. It is worth noting that there is a break on Saturday night until Sunday morning so the lab will not be occupied during this time. Everyone is also responsible for ensuring that the lab is left in the manner that it was found (or better). If it isn’t then it is likely that we won’t be allowed to do it again.

## When can I go home?

The celebration of achievements will take place at **1500 on Sunday 22nd March**. You will have 3 minutes to pitch your game and show a video of your game. This will take place in **Robert Blackburn Lecture Theatre A**. The teams should also be prepared to answer questions about their game.
And, to answer the actual question, it should all be done and dusted by **1700**.
