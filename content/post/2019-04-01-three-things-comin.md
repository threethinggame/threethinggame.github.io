Lyrics below:  
1  Code, Code on.  
2  Code on, Code, Code on Three Thing Game  
3  Three Thing's Comin  
4  Three Thing's Comin  
5  It's Comin, It's Comin, It's Comin, It's Comin  

6  Preceded by our fame, we came  
7  Bringing again, another Three Thing Game, it's  
8  Never the same.  
9  No, it's fabulous  
10 And you simply must  
11 Form a team and just, having a go's a plus  
12 Be a star,  
13 Extra-curricular  
14 With this on your CV, you're sure to go far  
15 Seeking employment  
16 Good for paying your rent  
17 Taking part helps you discover the source of pure enjoyment  
18 Write code, or make art, compose tunes  
19 Craft sounds, whatever you want to  
20 Work together and  
21 Just like you planned  
22 Create games for this excellent Jam  
23 Now you understand  
24 And you're showing it to all your friends  
25 Magnificent, And you know the fun will never end  
26 Different, You know that I can recommend  
27 The Three Thing Game is back so you should come on and  
 
Chorus   
28 (Register! Cause Three Thing's comin)  
29 No excuse so (Register! Cause Three Thing's comin)  
30 Right now, you just gotta (Register! Cause Three Thing's comin)  
31 Like this, Let me see you signin' up, register, come on!  
32 (Register! Cause Three Thing's comin)  
33 Come on now and (Register! Cause Three Thing's comin)  
34 Don't wait, it is worth it (Register! Cause Three Thing's comin)  
35 Come on (Register!)
