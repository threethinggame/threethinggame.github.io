      <description>For those not in the know, Three Thing Game is a programming Game Jam run over (approximately) 24 hours. Teams of enthusiasts (that’s you people, as well as me and my ‘kind’) gather to challenge themselves to create a game based on 3 random words that they will be given. At the end of the 24 hours you get to subject your game to a thorough Judging against various criteria like: adherence to the Things, how complete is your game, and how much money you slip the judge discreetly.</description>
